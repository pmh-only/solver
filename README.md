## Web Server

The bot serves a responsive `Hello, World!` page from `/` and a health check from `/healthz` on
`PORT` (default `3000`). Set `WEB_HOST` to control the listening interface.

## Interaction Access

Set `ADMIN_USER_IDS` to a comma- or whitespace-separated list of Discord user IDs. Private
commands, context menus, modals, and autocomplete are restricted to those users. Components on
public messages and commands launched through the constrained Pubtab remain available to everyone.

## Spotify MCP

The `/a` agent receives Spotify search, library, playlist, and playback tools when
authenticated. Create a Spotify developer app with
`https://<your-public-service>/mcp/spotify/callback` as a redirect URI. Then ask `/a` to authenticate
Spotify and include the app's client ID and exact redirect URI. The agent returns a Spotify login
link; opening it completes authentication through the bot's existing web server. No environment
configuration or terminal command is required.

Refreshable credentials and the non-secret client ID are stored under `data/.spotify-mcp`, alongside
the bot's existing persistent data. Existing `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`
environment configuration remains supported.
